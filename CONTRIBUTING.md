This repository is under dual EPL/Apache2.0 license.

As such, an ECA check is performed in PRs to formally confirm that you accept that any work you commit to this repository will be licensed equally.

This ECA check requires you to create an account on Eclipse's official website, which some of you may feel overcomplicated when submitting one-off, small PRs.

In such cases, you may place the following text in your PR to explicitly state that you agree for that PR to not break the current licensing.
```
I state that I was not able to sign ECA with my GitHub private email,
since I wouldn't want to disclose my public email for this particular commit,
and that therefore I grant the permission to copy/merge my PR if accepted
```

Note that I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice: just a tradition passed down from other projects with the hope to avoid license issues in the future.
